  <h2 id="superhero">What makes a superhero?</h2>
  <p>
      A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn’t. So
      in order to be a superhero, <b>you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could
      possess</b>, and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be
      considered a superhero.
  </p>
  <p>
      For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective
      story or human-interest story. But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a
      superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I
      assume he becomes a superhero.
